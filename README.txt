# autograder
Scripts that enable working with GitHub repos for class projects and HackerRank (For Work) for assignments.

convert_registrars_class_list.py takes a csv classlist from MSU's Office of the Registrar and converts it into two files, 
one that is used by HackerRank for bulk candidate invitations, and other used by autograder.py to connect MSU NetIDs to Names.

send_hackerrank_reports.py takes a zip folder of HackerRank pdfs (downloaded from the website) and emails them to their respective students.

convert_hackerrank.py takes a CSV report (downloaded from the completed HackerRank test) and converts it into a form autograder.py can use.

autograder.py does a whole lot (mostly involving GitHub grading), but with regards to HackerRank it can convert the file 
generated by convert_hackerrank.py into a file that can be uploaded to D2L (using the convert-to-D2L command).

For info on how the autograder works for GitHub, I'd advise a sit down meeting with Josh Nahum (nahumjos@msu.edu)
